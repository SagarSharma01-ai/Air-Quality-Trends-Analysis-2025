## 🎯 Project Objective
Air pollution is the silent crisis of our times. This project analyzes a **10-Year Dataset (2015-2025)** to visualize air quality trends across India, with a specific focus on the **Delhi NCR** region. The goal was to identify the primary pollutants and high-risk zones.

## 💡 Key Findings

### 1. The "Very Unhealthy" Reality
For the projected year 2025, Delhi recorded a **Max AQI of 397**. The average AQI hovers around **208**, placing the city consistently in the "Unhealthy" category.

### 2. The Primary Culprit: PM2.5
The analysis confirms that **PM2.5** is the most frequent primary pollutant (Frequency: 68). This indicates combustion-based pollution (vehicles/industry) is the main issue, not just road dust.

### 3. Regional Hotspots (The Pollution Belt)
High pollution isn't limited to Delhi. Neighboring industrial hubs show alarming levels:
- **Hajipur:** 197 AQI
- **Gurugram:** 190 AQI
- **Rohtak:** 178 AQI

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Data Source:** CPCB & Monitoring Data (`day_wise_aqi_data.csv`).
- **Power BI:** For Data Modeling, Geo-Spatial Mapping, and Trend Analysis.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values across 10 years of daily records.

---

## 📈 Recommendations
1.  **PM2.5 Focus:** Shift policy focus from dust control to combustion control (vehicles/stubble burning).
2.  **Unified Action:** Gurugram and Ghaziabad are equally affected; an NCR-wide unified action plan is mandatory.
